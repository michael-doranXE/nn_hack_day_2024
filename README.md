# Usage
* Install from PyPi using pip. Either:
    * `pip install edapp-python-sdk`
    * `pip3 install edapp-python-sdk`
* Run `edapp_export` -  a config file will be created in the same directory
* Open it up and add your API Token
* Re-Run `edapp_export` and all your data will be exported to both CSV and a SQLite database.

# What to do with the data?
These tables work best in a BI tool to model your data. Power BI sample coming soon.
